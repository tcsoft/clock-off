# clock-off

I created this project so that my son with ADHD had more control over his behaviour in the mornings before breakfast.

The idea is that his clock only shows the time when he's supposed to be awake. He does not have to fumble and crash about with
torches and turning his light on to annoy his mother early in the morning.

You can set the time the clock will show by putting in a startTime (24hr format)
It can be different for weekdays and weekends

You can set the bedtime or lights out time by changing endTime

This requires a Four Letter pHAT for your Raspberry Pi available from Pimoroni.
